# Task:
Develop a simple mobile app which uses the GitHub REST API to display the list of public
repositories belonging to an organization, plus a very simple settings screen.

## UX Design
1. An item in the repositories list shows the repository name and description.
2. Settings is a static screen with hardcoded text and image. Any image can be used.
3. Any color and font can be used to develop this application.


# Estimations:
1. Project setup                    1h      RealTime: 30m
2. Navigation with empty pages      1h      RealTime:  2h
3. Implement settings screen        1h      RealTime:  1h
4. Implement Repositories screen    1h      RealTime:  3h 

# Comments:
It took me a little bit longer to play around with components design and search functionality of repositories.
Developed on Android, but solution does not include custom native code, so it should also work on iOS.

## What to add into production app:
1. Add unit tests
2. Logging
3. CI/CD pipelines
4. Internationalization library like i18n
