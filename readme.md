# Task:
Develop a simple mobile app which uses the GitHub REST API to display the list of public
repositories belonging to an organization, plus a very simple settings screen.

## UX Design
1. An item in the repositories list shows the repository name and description.
2. Settings is a static screen with hardcoded text and image. Any image can be used.
3. Any color and font can be used to develop this application.
